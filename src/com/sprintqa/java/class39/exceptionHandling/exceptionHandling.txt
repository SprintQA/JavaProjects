An exception is an unexpected event that occurs at runtime due to an error. Exceptions disrupt the normal flow of a program.

Handling Exceptions
--------------------
You can handle exceptions within your code so that the program doesn't crash and so that you can provide a
meaningful message in case of an error.
To do so, you use a try/catch clause.

Polymorphism with Exceptions
----------------------------
When handling exceptions, you can also use the superclass as a way to catch broader exceptions.
All exceptions inherit from the Exception class.

Handling Multiple Exceptions
----------------------------
There can be multiple catch clauses to handle different types of exceptions.
If the multiple catch clauses contain related exceptions, the subclass’ catch clause must appear first.
Otherwise, it will never have the possibility of reaching other catch clauses.
The way we do that is by using the pipe symbol: |.

The finally Clause
---------------------
A finally clause can optionally be added below any catch clauses.

Rethrowing Exceptions
---------------------
When a method throws an exception, it is assumed that the exception will be caught and handled, or rethrown by any
calling methods.

Throwing Exceptions
--------------------
Your method can initiate the throwing of an exception by using the word throw inside of the method's body
and instantiating an exception.
