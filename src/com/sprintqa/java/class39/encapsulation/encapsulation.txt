Encapsulation
-------------
The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:
- declare class variables/attributes as private
- provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable

The get method returns the variable value, and the set method sets the value.
Getter and Setter Methods:
Getters and Setters are used to effectively protect your data, particularly when creating classes. For each instance variable,
a getter method returns its value while a setter method sets or updates its value. Getters and setters are also known as
accessors and mutators, respectively.

Why Encapsulation?
------------------
Better control of class attributes and methods
Class attributes can be made read-only (if you only use the get method), or write-only (if you only use the set method)
Flexible: the programmer can change one part of the code without affecting other parts
Increased security of data.
