Abstraction
-----------
Abstraction is defined as something that exists in theory but does not have a concrete existence.
In Java, we have the reserved word, abstract — which is a non-access modifier that can be used on classes and methods.
It is used when you want to define a template for a class or a method, but do not intend for it to be used as is.

An abstract class doesn't only have to contain abstract methods.
It can contain implemented methods as well.

Abstraction Key Points
-----------------------
- Abstract classes and methods are templates that are meant to be implemented by their subclasses.
- The classes and methods are declared abstract by using the abstract keyword.
- If a subclass inherits from an abstract class, it must implement its abstract methods or the class itself must be
declared as abstract.
- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated. They are only to be used as a superclass. If even one method in a class is abstract,
then the entire class must be declared abstract as well.
