Definition
-----------
The this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.

Usage
----------
You can use this anywhere a reference to an object of the current class’ type is permitted.

When to use this?
------------------
The most common use of the this keyword is to eliminate the confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name.
This is called instance variable hiding.

Cautions
---------
The use of this in such a context can sometimes be
confusing, and some programmers are careful not to use local variables and
formal parameter names that hide instance variables. Of course, other
programmers believe the contrary—that it is a good convention to use the same
names for clarity, and use this to overcome the instance variable hiding. It is a
matter of taste which approach you adopt.
