Definition
----------
The super keyword refers to superclass (parent) objects.

Usage
-------
Whenever a subclass needs to refer to its immediate superclass, it can do so by use of the keyword super.

Also, the super has two general forms. The first calls the superclass’ constructor.
The second is used to access a member of the superclass that has been hidden by a member of a subclass.

When to use super?
------------------
The most common use of the super keyword is to eliminate the confusion between superclasses and subclasses
that have members with the same name.
