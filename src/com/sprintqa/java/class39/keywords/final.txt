The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable
(impossible to inherit or override).

Notes
-------
A field can be declared as final. Doing so prevents its contents from being
modified, making it, essentially, a constant. This means that you must initialize
a final field when it is declared. You can do this in one of two ways: First, you
can give it a value when it is declared. Second, you can assign it a value within
a constructor.
In addition to fields, both method parameters and local variables can be
declared final. Declaring a parameter final prevents it from being changed
within the method. Declaring a local variable final prevents it from being
assigned a value more than once.
The keyword final can also be applied to methods, but its meaning is
substantially different than when it is applied to variables.
