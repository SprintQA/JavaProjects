Definition
-----------
The static keyword is a non-access modifier used for a class's attributes and methods to be accessed without creating 
any object of that class.

Usage
--------
You can declare variables and methods of a class as static.

Example
--------
The most common example is the main() method.

When to use static?
--------------------
1. If you're writing utility classes and they are not supposed to be changed.
2. If you are sure that the definition of the method will never be changed or overridden.
3. If there is some code that can easily be shared by all the instance methods, extract that code into a static method.

Rule of Thumb
-------------
Ask yourself "does it make sense to call this method, even if no Obj has been constructed yet?" If so, it should definitely be static.

Cautions
-----------
Methods declared as static have several restrictions:
• They can only directly call other static methods of their class.
• They can only directly access static variables of their class.
• They cannot refer to this or super in any way.
